# Temporary Repo for Clustering on AWS Lambdas

This repo holds the code for running the latest optimised-k-means clustering algorithm (derived from the `gridsample` repo on 9th Feb 2024) on AWS Lambda for the HPLS project (round 3).

To do:

- Clean up and flesh out.
- Move all clustering-related code here and keep `gridsample` for data processing and pipeline code.
